ABOUT THIS PROJECT :
            
            HouseHunt is a web-based rental platform designed to help users find and rent houses easily. The platform allows users to browse rental listings by category (e.g., apartments, villas, studios), view property images, check prices, and get address/location details. It includes user authentication (login/signup), a responsive user interface, and an option to “Buy Now” or contact the owner.
